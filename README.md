# Dooshen Tasks Mobile App ✅

A modern, cross-platform task management application built with React Native (Expo) and powered by a Convex real-time backend. This project showcases a robust mobile architecture, dynamic theming, and a polished user interface.

## Features

-   **Cross-Platform:** Single codebase for iOS, Android, and Web, thanks to Expo.
-   **Real-time Backend:** Utilizes Convex for seamless, real-time data synchronization.
-   **Dynamic Theming:** Full support for light, dark, and system-default themes, with persistence across sessions.
-   **Modern UI/UX:** Features like parallax scroll views, collapsible sections, and haptic feedback for an enhanced user experience.
-   **File-Based Routing:** Simplified navigation and screen management using Expo Router.
-   **Native Capabilities:** Leverages native components like SF Symbols on iOS for a platform-consistent look and feel.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   Expo Go app on your mobile device (for testing) or an emulator/simulator setup.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dooshen-tasks.git
    cd dooshen-tasks
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Convex deployment URL.

    ```env
    # .env.local
    EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Start the Development Server**
    This command starts the Metro bundler.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Run on a device or emulator:**
    -   **iOS:** Press `i` in the terminal to launch in the iOS Simulator.
    -   **Android:** Press `a` in the terminal to launch in the Android Emulator.
    -   **Web:** Press `w` in the terminal to launch in your web browser.

## API Integration

The application's backend is managed through Convex. The core functions are defined in the `convex/` directory.

### `convex/tasks.ts`

This file handles data operations related to tasks.

#### `GET /tasks`
Retrieves a list of all tasks from the database. This is a query function accessible from the client.

**Request**:
No payload is required. The function is called via the Convex client library.
```typescript
// Example client-side usage
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";

const tasks = useQuery(api.tasks.get);
```

**Response**:
An array of task objects. Since no schema is defined (`convex/schema.ts` is empty), the structure is dynamic. A potential structure would be:
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "_id_string",
    "_creationTime": 1672531200000,
    "text": "Complete the project documentation",
    "isCompleted": false
  },
  {
    "_id": "another_id_string",
    "_creationTime": 1672534800000,
    "text": "Deploy to production",
    "isCompleted": false
  }
]
```
